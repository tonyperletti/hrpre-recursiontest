Helping with Hack Reactor pre-course recursion testing

The recursion project getElementsByClassName.js uses getElementsByClassNameSpec.js 
to test your function with webpage content and compare against the built-in 
getElementsByClassName method. This simple webpage models the HTML content from 
getElementsByClassNameSpec.js and logs the comparison output for the 
getElementsByClassName method and your getElementsByClassName function.

Within the file getElementsByClassName-Test.html, inside the <head> element, 
make sure to change the relative path to your getElementsByClassName.js file.
